# Spring_REST_JPA_Shopping_Cart
A sample spring boot REST API app that enables CRUD operations on Products. Users can place Orders containing multiple such products. The price of products can be changed but already placed orders will still be able to show the old prices used during order placement. Spring JPA and H2 in memory DB are used for this app.
